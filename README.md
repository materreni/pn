# This is a Javascript restoration of «*P<sub>n</sub>=n!*» (2006) by Iván Marino

First exhibited in March 2006, [*P<sub>n</sub>=n!*](http://www.ivan-marino.net/08/swf_as2/desastres/06.html) was a media art installation developed in Flash by the argentinian artist Iván Marino. A sequence from the film *“La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc”* (1928) by Carl T. Dreyer was divided into its constituent shots and repurposed to address the idea of torture as an algorithm, a piece of software. For every new sequence in the project, an individual shot from the film was randomly selected and reedited into a new progression that would fatally mirror the three semantic cornerstones present in several torture procedures: victims, victimizers and torture instruments.

For this conservation project I rewrote the code from scratch with ES6, used the MediaSource Element to manage video playback and built a responsive CSS layout to meet the requirements of the modern web. Although the source video was reprocessed with HandbrakeCLI from a more recent transfer of the film, I took care to mimic the look and feel of the original *.flv files in After Effects.
